### Focuses

The primary learning goals for this project are:

- Use an agile process to turn well defined requirements into deployed and production ready software

- Explore and implement new concepts, patterns, or libraries that have not been explicitly taught while at Turing
- Practice an advanced, professional git workflow (see whole-team expectations)
- Gain more experience using continuous integration tools to build and automate the deployment of features in various environments
- Build applications that execute in development, test, CI, and production environments
- Focus on communication between front-end and back-end teams in order to complete and deploy features that have been outlined by the project spec
